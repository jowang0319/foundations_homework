### Questions:
1. while changing .str to .int, error as: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ' .. ' Not able to replace it.
2. Can we color the scatter plot or other plots by Continent or a different aspect?
3. The scatter plot with GDP seems really strange, how can I check the data? I tried like sort, head and tails, it seems to be fine, just strange in the scatter plot.
4. What do we do When there're too many data?
5. Not able to sort the result of .groupby().mean(),
